## About Me
Hi, my name is Murong Yue. I am a Ph.D. student at George Mason University (GMU), where I am luckily working with Prof. [Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/). I earned a master’s degree from the University of Southern California (USC) and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). Before starting my Ph.D., I also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Alibaba AI Labs.

My research interests include:

**LLM Reasoning**: I am interested in how to *dynamically adapt* reasoning strategies based on the nature of the input problem. This includes selecting the appropriate LLM model, choosing the reasonable reasoning paradigm, and utilizing tools effectively.

**Building and Evaluating LLM Agents for Interdisciplinary Applications**: I am also passionate about how to construct and evaluate LLM-based agents for emerging tasks in interdisciplinary applications. Besdies, I am also working on the evaluation in open-ended tasks.

**Trustworthy LLMs**: I am also interested in uncertainty estimation and LLM jailbreaking.
