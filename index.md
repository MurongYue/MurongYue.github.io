## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at George Mason University(GMU) where I am luckily working with Prof. [Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/). Prior to my journey at GMU, I earned a master’s degree from the University of Southern California and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University. My research interest is to construct reliable and efficient interactive LLM system. Currently, my focus revolves around designing efficient, safe and affordable LLM agents for tackling complex reasoning tasks.
