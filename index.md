## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at George Mason University(GMU) where I am luckily working with Prof. [Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/). Prior to my journey at GMU, I earned a master’s degree from the University of Southern California and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University. I have spent time working at Alibaba Group as a machine learning engineer.


My research goal is to construct reliable and efficient interactive LLM systems. Currently, my focus revolves around designing efficient, safe and affordable LLM agents of tackling complex reasoning tasks.
