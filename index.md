## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at George Mason University(GMU) where I am luckily working with Prof. [Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/). Prior to my journey at GMU, I earned a master’s degree from the University of Southern California and a bachelor’s degree from Beijing Jiaotong University. I have spent time working at Alibaba Group as a machine learning engineer.

 

My research goal is to construct practical, task-oriented interactive AI systems that are both reliable and efficient. Currently, my focus revolves around designing efficient, robust and affordable LLM agents of tackling complex reasoning tasks or engaging in human skill training. Furthermore, I'm interested in creating a novel reasoning benchmark for Augmented Language Models (ALM).
